## Introduction: Data & Cars

I moved to Boston without any transportation. I take a morning stroll to the train station, and I train hop to my office every morning for work. 

Understanding data analysis and the ability to provide insights based on data preferences and trends, I wanted to use my skill set to provide some assistance in finding some reliable transportation: a car.

Problem is, I do not know much about cars and what they offer. Sure, I know a Mustang from a Dodge Challenger, but that does not answer my question: what is the best make, model, and year of car for my goals for transportation?

Based on my current office location, and based on the fact I am living in the bustling city of Boston, there are a few key guidelines I will utilize to ensure accurate data insights. First, and obvious, I want a safe & durable car. I want to be protected, and I want it to last me as long as possible. I also want an economically-sound car. Not only does this mean average cost, this may take in account the average repair costs (looking at you, BMW), miles per gallon (MPG) and fuel efficiency, as well as other related finances.

Come along with me as I use data to inform a personal decision based on my values to try and find the best car for me.
